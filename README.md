# Introduction

Hi there! Thank you, for peering into this little repo, which is dedicated to the making of a simple, yet fun Spotify frontend.
As this is my first truly &ldquo;open&rdquo; project, and my first one in Emacs Lisp, I&rsquo;ll be taking your advice and recommendations with an open
and curious mind. I can&rsquo;t truly promise anything groundbreaking, but if you&rsquo;re interested in this journey of a noob to the world of
open source, stick around, and you might get something useful out of it.
